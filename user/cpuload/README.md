# cpuload

This is a simple CPU load program generating the given percent
of CPU load. For example, 65% of 1 CPU.

Actually, it's similar 'stress-ng' with '-l' or '--cpu-load' option.

I wrote this program using multi-process model and signals
(SIGCONT and SIGSTOP in 2007.

So, this is not a reinvention of stress, but they are. :)

BTW, this program reminds me of another program that I wrote around 1994
on a mainframe computer using assembly language.
